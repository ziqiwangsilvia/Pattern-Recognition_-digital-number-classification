# Pattern-Recognition_-digital-number-classification

Notice:
1. All needed datasets should be in the form of 'prdataset' and this should be done through functions 'my_rep' or 'my_rep_HOG', etc. 
2. HOG.mat and PCA.mat are the comparison of errors obtained by differnet classifiers.

Todo:
1. Have a look at the function 'my_rep_HOG' and extract other features in the same way. For instance, sift, which is important according to the literature. (BTW I don't think Harris is necessary for training classifies, it's for matching.)

2. Try to combine classifiers and features

3. Possibly semi-supervised learning ( The manual said that 'It goes without saying that
you may not use the test error to optimise your system in any way')
